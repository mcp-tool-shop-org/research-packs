# Operator Playbook

This document distills operating doctrine for running research packs to freeze using [`research-os`](https://github.com/mcp-tool-shop-org/research-os). It is a living document — each arc contributes earned doctrine.

## Source format preferences

### Avoid GitHub UI HTML

GitHub release pages, issue list pages, and wiki pages fetch successfully (HTTP 200, ~600 KB body) but deliver JavaScript-rendered chrome, not page content. The research-os fetch layer captures what the server returns; it has no headless browser. Claims extracted from GitHub UI HTML are grounded to navigation boilerplate ("GitHub Copilot", "GitHub Spark", "GitHub Sponsors"), not research content.

**Prefer instead:**
- `raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/master/<file>` — raw file content, no chrome
- `api.github.com/repos/<owner>/<repo>/releases?per_page=20` — JSON release metadata
- `api.github.com/repos/<owner>/<repo>/tags?per_page=20` — JSON tag list (use when a repo uses tags instead of releases, e.g., ComfyUI-Manager)
- `api.github.com/search/issues?q=repo:<Owner>/<Repo>+keyword1+keyword2&per_page=20` — keyword-filtered GitHub issues (see below)
- `docs.<project>.org/` or `<project>.readthedocs.io/` — server-rendered documentation pages

**Check first:** Fetch the URL and verify that the response contains real prose, not JavaScript bundle tags. A 200 OK with `<script type="module">` dominant content is a GitHub UI HTML page.

### Use the GitHub Search API for keyword-filtered issues

The GitHub Issues endpoint (`/repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues`) silently ignores the `q=` parameter. A URL like:

```
api.github.com/repos/Owner/Repo/issues?state=all&q=missing%20model&per_page=20
```

returns the 20 most recent issues regardless of the `q=` value. The parameter is not an error — it is silently dropped.

For keyword-filtered results, use the search API:

```
api.github.com/search/issues?q=repo:Owner/Repo+keyword1+keyword2&per_page=20
```

The search endpoint returns a `{total_count, items}` JSON dict (not a plain array). The first excerpt for this source type is typically a JSON metadata fragment (`[{"url":"...","repository_url":"..."}`); excerpts from `_002` onward contain coherent issue prose.

### `llms.txt` aggregate sources

Projects that publish `llms.txt` (e.g., `docs.comfy.org/llms.txt`) bundle their full documentation as a single concatenated file for LLM consumption. These sources produce expected `source_dominance` — 50%+ of extracted claims from a single URL is normal and correct. The triage layer's `parked_overdense_source` cap handles this correctly.

Approve `llms.txt` URLs when you need breadth over precision; use individual doc page URLs when you need a targeted section. Expect triage to cap the aggregate source; the net accepted claims will be proportionate to the quality of the underlying docs, not the file size.

## Discovery

### Operator-staged URLs over LLM discovery for code-repository topics

LLM-based discovery (`research-os discover run`) works well for topics where the source landscape is broadly documented and stable. For code-repository topics (framework documentation, tool configuration, version-specific behavior), LLM discover hallucination is high — discovered URLs are often wrong repos, wrong orgs, or invented paths.

**The reliable path for code-repository topics:**
1. Verify URLs manually against the canonical project documentation, GitHub API, and search results before gather.
2. Stage them in `urls.operator-staged.txt` in the section directory.
3. Run `research-os gather <section> --url <url>` or `--approved` against the staged list.
4. Bypass `research-os discover run` entirely for this class of topic.

The `urls.operator-staged.txt` pattern is a first-class input; `discover run` is an optional accelerator for topics where the source landscape is well-indexed.

## Contradiction detection

### Heuristic detector is the standard for narrow-topic documentation sections

The ollama-intern contradiction detector uses a Jaccard token-overlap prefilter before running LLM classification on pairs. On narrow-topic sections (all claims share vocabulary like "workflow," "json," "schema," "install," "node"), the prefilter passes a large fraction of the N×(N-1)/2 pairs for LLM classification. With 50+ claims and high token overlap, the detector can stall for 20+ minutes with zero output.

**Workaround:** Clear `OLLAMA_INTERN_MODEL` before running `contradict map` to force the heuristic detector:

```powershell
# PowerShell
Remove-Item Env:OLLAMA_INTERN_MODEL -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
research-os contradict map <section> --triaged-only
```

The heuristic detector is pure CPU, completes in seconds for 1,000+ pairs, and correctly finds zero contradictions on sections where claims describe orthogonal aspects of the same phenomenon (failure modes, configuration settings, schema fields).

**When to use the ollama-intern detector:** Wide-topic sections where claims span genuinely different domains (e.g., different tools in a survey section, different failure categories). The prefilter passes fewer pairs because vocabulary overlap is low, so the LLM calls complete in reasonable time.

---

## Model environment discipline

### Set `OLLAMA_INTERN_MODEL` explicitly via PowerShell before every LLM-dependent command

`research-os` uses `OLLAMA_INTERN_MODEL` as the environment variable for the Ollama model. Every LLM-dependent command — `claim extract`, `review`, `contradict map` — reads this variable. If it is unset, the commands default to `hermes3:8b`; if that model is not pulled, they fall back to heuristic silently.

```powershell
# PowerShell — set before each LLM-dependent command
$env:OLLAMA_INTERN_MODEL = "hermes3:8b"
research-os claim extract <section>
research-os review <section> --triaged-only --preset hermes-two-pass --profile hermes-two-pass
```

**Why PowerShell, not Bash env-prefix:** On Windows, the Bash `VAR=value command` env-prefix pattern fails due to shell dispatch. Set the variable as a PowerShell `$env:` assignment.

**Silent fallback risks:** If `OLLAMA_INTERN_MODEL` is set to a model that isn't pulled, claim extract silently falls to the heuristic extractor. Heuristic extractor produces `parked_weak_scope` claims (quality ~0.15) vs ollama_intern's `needs_scope_repair` claims (quality ~0.75). Running `claim extract` without the env var can leave zero claims selected for review. Verify the model is pulled before running LLM-dependent commands.

**Background processes:** `OLLAMA_INTERN_MODEL` set in a foreground shell does not propagate into background processes spawned mid-session on Windows. If a command spawns a subprocess in a new shell, re-set the env var in that subprocess.

## Publisher-null interpretation

### `publisher: null` is non-deterministic — not a signal of low source quality

The `publisher` field in research-os source cards is populated by an extraction step that can fail for multiple reasons. Across the ComfyUI arc (10 sessions, 8 sections), the same domain (`docs.comfy.org`) returned `publisher: "docs.comfy.org"` in some sessions and `publisher: null` in others, with no deterministic pattern. GitHub API sources (`raw.githubusercontent.com`, `api.github.com`) consistently return `publisher: null`.

**Do not use `publisher: null` as a quality signal.** A source card with `publisher: null` may be a high-quality primary source from the canonical maintainer.

**Workaround for the gate:** Set `min_independent_publishers: 0` in the pack gate config when publisher extraction is unreliable. This prevents the gate from failing on publisher diversity when the field cannot be trusted. The admitted sources are still evaluated on accepted claim count and source diversity.

## Community-distribution tier

### Public community galleries are not text-stable under the v0.1 fetch model

Community workflow galleries (OpenArt, CivitAI, Comfy Workflows) are JavaScript-rendered single-page applications or payment-walled. The research-os fetch layer captures static HTTP responses — it has no JavaScript execution context.

- Payment-walled URLs return HTTP 402 or redirect to login pages
- JS-CSR shells return 200 OK with a Next.js or React bundle — no extractable prose
- `<head>` meta tags may contain a few words of context but not substantive research content

This is not an extraction failure — it is a structural incompatibility between the v0.1 fetch model and client-side-rendered sources. For topics where community galleries are the primary evidence surface (workflow sharing behavior, distribution metadata, community adoption patterns), this means the evidence base is limited to canonical documentation and GitHub issues that discuss gallery-side behavior from the user perspective.

**Mitigation:** Use GitHub Search API issues to capture user-reported evidence about community distribution behavior. The `repo:<Owner>/<Repo>+workflow+missing+nodes` search surface captures community-facing frictions even when the gallery URLs themselves are inaccessible.

## Session junk claims

### Consider `research-os invalidate` before running `contradict map` when early sessions gathered bad sources

The `claims.jsonl` ledger is append-only. If session 1 gathered JavaScript-chrome sources and produced 50–100 junk HTML-chrome claims, those claims remain in the pool across all subsequent sessions. When `contradict map` runs later (after good sources have been gathered), it pairs junk claims against quality claims, generating a large number of false-positive contradictions (junk×quality category).

For sections where session 1 used bad sources and later sessions gathered replacements:

1. Run `research-os invalidate <section> --source <bad_source_id>` to mark the bad source's claims as invalid before running `contradict map`.
2. Or: accept the contaminated contradiction pool and use the sampling protocol to bulk-classify junk×quality pairs by structural category (see below).

---

## Contradiction sampling protocol for large corpora

When a section has more than 100 unresolved contradictions after `contradict map`, individual per-entry judgment at scale is intractable. Use this protocol:

1. Sample at least 10–15 contradictions across structural categories (junk×quality, quality×quality, junk×junk).
2. Classify the sample individually with per-entry reasons.
3. Identify category-level structural patterns from the sample ("junk×quality where junk is HTML chrome", "quality×quality where claims are complementary aspects of the same feature").
4. Bulk-classify remaining contradictions only by structural category, with the category's shared reason explicitly citing sample evidence ("Sampled 15 of 445 quality×quality pairs; 15/15 were complementary-claim false positives. Bulk rejection per category.").
5. Record both the sample evidence and the bulk reason in the closure ledger.
6. Do NOT use bulk classification on high/blocking severity contradictions — those require per-entry individual judgment.

## v0.1 self-dogfood arc — structural notes

The v0.1 dogfood pack used `mistral-nemo:12b` as the extractor and reviewer model (hermes3:8b not pulled on the 5080 rig at the time). The `hermes-two-pass` review profile is calibrated against the seeded-failure fixture with `hermes3:8b` as the canonical model. The dogfood arc's proof is honest — it discloses the model substitution — but a hermes3-based receipt is Experiment 6 in the roadmap.

The primary lesson from the v0.1 arc is architectural, not source-quality: the overproduction-then-curate design (extract abundance → triage shape → review accept synthesis-worthy) works. The gate's readiness predicate must count active blockers, not candidate-set completeness. Pattern 2 (active-blocker readiness) was earned during the v0.1 dogfood arc; its enforcement was extended to cover the calibrated reviewer's full decision vocabulary (`needs_scope_repair`, `needs_source_repair`, `needs_human_review`) during v1 Experiment 1 (commit `22b5dba`).
